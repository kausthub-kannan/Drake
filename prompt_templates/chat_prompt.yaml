- answer: 'Sharding is a technique for dividing a large database into smaller, manageable
    parts called shards, which are stored across multiple servers or nodes. This process
    enhances scalability, performance, and fault tolerance by distributing data and
    processing load. Sharding works by partitioning data based on criteria like geographic
    location, user ID, or time period, and each shard is responsible for a subset
    of the data. This method allows for horizontal scaling, improving the system''s
    capacity to handle large volumes of data and requests efficiently.


    The system uses a shard key to identify which shard contains the required data
    for a query. The shard key is a unique identifier that maps data to its corresponding
    shard. Upon receiving a query, the system determines the appropriate shard and
    forwards the query to the correct server or node.


    **Features of Sharding:**

    - Sharding makes the database smaller, faster, and more manageable.

    - It can be complex to implement.

    - Sharding reduces transaction costs and allows each shard to read and write its
    own data.

    - Many NoSQL databases offer auto-sharding.

    - Failure of one shard does not affect the data processing of other shards.


    **Benefits of Sharding:**

    1. **Improved Scalability:** Sharding allows horizontal scaling by adding more
    servers or nodes, enhancing the system''s capacity to handle large volumes of
    data and requests.

    2. **Increased Performance:**By distributing data across multiple servers or nodes,
    sharding improves performance, resulting in faster response times and better throughput.

    3. **Fault Tolerance:** Sharding provides fault tolerance as the system can continue
    to function even if one or more servers or nodes fail, thanks to data replication
    across multiple servers or nodes.

    4. **Reduced Costs:** Horizontal scaling with sharding can be more cost-effective
    than vertical scaling by upgrading hardware, as it can be done using commodity
    hardware, which is typically less expensive than high-end servers.'
  context: "It is a very important concept that helps the system to keep data in different\
    \ resources\naccording to the sharding process. The word \u201CShard\u201D means\
    \ \u201Ca small part of a\nwhole\u201C. Hence Sharding means dividing a larger\
    \ part into smaller parts. In DBMS,\nSharding is a type of DataBase partitioning\
    \ in which a large database is divided or\n\npartitioned into smaller data and\
    \ different nodes. These shards are not only smaller,\nbut also faster and hence\
    \ easily manageable.\nHow does Sharding work?\nIn a sharded system, the data is\
    \ partitioned into shards based on a predetermined\ncriterion. For example, a\
    \ sharding scheme may divide the data based on geographic\nlocation, user ID,\
    \ or time period. Once the data is partitioned, it is distributed across\nmultiple\
    \ servers or nodes. Each server or node is responsible for storing and processing\
    \ a\nsubset of the data.\nExample:\n\nTo query data from a sharded database, the\
    \ system needs to know which shard contains\nthe required data. This is achieved\
    \ using a shard key, which is a unique identifier that is\nused to map the data\
    \ to its corresponding shard. When a query is received, the system\nuses the shard\
    \ key to determine which shard contains the required data and then sends\nthe\
    \ query to the appropriate server or node.\nFeatures of Sharding:\n\uF0B7 Sharding\
    \ makes the Database smaller\n\uF0B7 Sharding makes the Database faster\n\uF0B7\
    \ Sharding makes the Database much more easily manageable\n\uF0B7 Sharding can\
    \ be a complex operation sometimes\n\uF0B7 Sharding reduces the transaction cost\
    \ of the Database\n\uF0B7 Each shard reads and writes its own data.\n\uF0B7 Many\
    \ NoSQL databases offer auto-sharding.\n\uF0B7 Failure of one shard doesn\u2019\
    t effect the data processing of other shards.\nBenefits of Sharding:\n1. Improved\
    \ Scalability: Sharding allows the system to scale horizontally by adding more\n\
    servers or nodes as the data grows. This improves the system\u2019s capacity to\
    \ handle\nlarge volumes of data and requests.\n\n2. Increased Performance: Sharding\
    \ distributes the data across multiple servers or\nnodes, which improves the system\u2019\
    s performance by reducing the load on each server\nor node. This results in faster\
    \ response times and better throughput.\n3. Fault Tolerance: Sharding provides\
    \ a degree of fault tolerance as the system can\ncontinue to function even if\
    \ one or more servers or nodes fail. This is because the data\nis replicated across\
    \ multiple servers or nodes, and if one fails, the others can continue\nto serve\
    \ the requests.\n4. Reduced Costs: Sharding allows the system to scale horizontally,\
    \ which can be more\ncost-effective than scaling vertically by upgrading hardware.\
    \ This is because horizontal\nscaling can be done"
